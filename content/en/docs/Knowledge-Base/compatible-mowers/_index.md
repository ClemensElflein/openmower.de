 These are the mowers that are compatible with the OpenMower project

The project got started on a YardForce Classic 500(B) and there are (photo) guides at this documentation on how to dissassemble and assemble it again.  
So the YF Classics 500(B) is from a users perspective the "best supported" mower.

The YF SA650ECO is the second model officially supported but there are no model specific guides yet.

**Howerver there are more Mowers from the YardForce brand compatible:**

In theory every YardForce model with the Core + Outer Frame Chassis (SA, SC, LUV, N and NX Line) that has a production year of 2019+ have compatible electronics to replace the stock mainboard by an openmower one.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
As of today the YardForce Compact, EasyMow, MowBest, XPower and MB series models are not (yet) compatible.  
The main reason is that the OpenMower mainboard does not fit in their chassis.
