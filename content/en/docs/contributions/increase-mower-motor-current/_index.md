Battery current limit is 3a, motor current limit is 6a. RPM limited to 3500. Disabled backing off when temp increases or voltage drops. I would use a 6amp fuse, seen drive motors report over 1a sometimes.

Instructions:
Open cover, replace fuse, upload central xESC config with [VESC-TOOL](https://vesc-project.com/vesc_tool).
