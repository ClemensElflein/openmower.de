There are YardForce spikes on Amazon and other sites like Etsy. This photo guide is about RoboClaws. 

In short:
 * remove wheels
 * (optionally) pre-drill holes, but people reported success even without that
 * attach spikes from inside
 * assemble back

Results:
 * much better traction on grass
 * noise on paving
 * probable damage to tiles
