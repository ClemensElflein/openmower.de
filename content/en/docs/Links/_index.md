Since the Open Mower project is quite complex, the parts are split among multiple websites and repositories. This page gives an overview of all important resources.

## Information Sources


### Documentation (this page)

üîó&nbsp;[https://openmower.de/docs](/docs)

**Interesting For:** All Users

This documentation contains reviewed information that is known to be correct and will not change too often. Consider this as your main entry point for information about the OpenMower project.

**Interesting For:** All Users

The Wiki is written by Open Mower users like you. It contains useful tips and information on running the Open Mower software. I'm not able to check all the information there all the time, so it might be that some guides are outdated or just not working. If you find any wrong information there, feel free to edit or tell me on Discord.

**Interesting For:** Users who are interested in motor control

This repository contains the hardware design for the BLDC motor controllers I'm using in this project. The design is based on the popular VESC BLDC motor controller and is compatible with the VESC firmware.


## Shop / Support

### Vermut's Shop

üîó&nbsp;[https://shop.devops.care/](https://shop.devops.care/)

This is the shop of Discord user Vermut. He's selling soldered and tested hardware kits for Open Mower builds. If you want to get started quickly, check his shop and get a kit. It includes most of the things you need to build the Open Mower.  
Some profits of each sale are going to me, so you do support the project by getting the kit.


### Patreon ‚ô•Ô∏è

üîó&nbsp;[https://patreon.com/ClemensElflein](https://patreon.com/ClemensElflein)

Working on the Open Mower project takes *a lot of time*. Since I'm self-employed, I really don't have too much time to spare. So if you want to enable me to work on the Open Mower project more, you can support me on Patreon! Thank you for helping me keep this project alive.
