{{% alert title="v2 Hardware Only!" color="warning" %}}
This guide here is for OpenMower v2.x Hardware!
If you have v1 Hardware, follow the legacy docs [here](https://openmower.de/archive/v1.0.2/docs/), because you will also need to modify the docking station!

You have **v1 hardware**, if:
- You are using a full-size Raspberry Pi
- Your mainboard shows version **v0.xx**
