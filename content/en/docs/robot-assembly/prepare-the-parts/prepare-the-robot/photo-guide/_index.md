### Unscrew top cover

### Pry the cover

This is a bit tricky in some parts, so I recommend you checking YouTube video
here: [<i class="fa fa-brands fa-youtube"></i> YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/_bImqD-pQSA?t=148). The relevant time is:
2:25 - 5:08.

### Unplug the cover

2 small wires on the front going to wheel sensors, and 1 wide wire from mainboard to cover UI board.
Screwdriver is in the pictures for illustrative purposes, you can simply hold it with your hand.

### Remove cover UI board

{{% alert title="ðŸ”§" color="warning" %}}
This section assumes that you are completely replacing the stock UI board with custom one. There is an experimental
option to reuse stock board with custom firmware. If you are going to go this path - leave it in place. You can find
more information in Discord, as of now it's work in progress.
