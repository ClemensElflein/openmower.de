## Configure the GPS board

This assumes that you are using the Ardusimple F9P GPS board. Support for other GPS receivers is a work in progress.



### Prerequisites

- **A Micro USB Cable**
- **A Windows PC**
- **Latest version of the u-center software:**<br/>
  :link:&nbsp;[https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/u-center](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/u-center)<br/>
  Don't get u-center V2, you will need u-center v1 for the F9P.
- **The GPS configuration file**<br/>
  :link:&nbsp;<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClemensElflein/OpenMower/main/configs/GPSConfig/Robot.txt" target="_blank">Robot.txt</a><br/>
  This will open in the browser. Use CTRL+S to download the file.



### Step 0: Update Firmware

Update the firmware of your Ardusimple board to version `ZED-F9P HPG 1.32`. There's a guide on the [Ardusimple Website](https://www.ardusimple.com/zed-f9p-firmware-update-with-simplertk2b/).



### Step 1: Open u-center and connect to your GPS

After installing u-center, connect your Ardusimple board using the "Power+GPS" USB socket to your Windows computer. You should see the blue LEDs of the board come on and Windows should recognize the device as a COM port.
With the module connected to your PC, open the u-center software. 

In u-center, first connect to your board by selecting the appropriate COM port in the `Receiver -> Connection` menu.



### Step 2: Transfer the configuration to the GPS

After successfully connecting to the board, you can transfer
the previously downloaded configuration file `Robot.txt` by opening the window `Tools -> Receiver Configuration ...`. In this window you open the `Robot.txt` using the `...` button and then transfer the configuration to the GPS by clicking the `Transfer File -> GNSS` button.



### Step 3: Save configuration to Flash

![Save Settings to Flash](save-settings-to-flash.jpg)

In order to keep the GPS configured even after powering it down, you need to save the current configuration to Flash memory. In order to do this, select `View -> Configuration View`. In the new window you need to select `CFG (Configuration)` in the list on the left side and then enable `Save current configuration`. Make sure that `0 - BBR` and `1 - FLASH` are both selected on the right side of the window. Once that's done, click the `Send` button in the lower toolbar of the window.



### Step 4: Done ðŸŽ‰

Your GPS is now configured for use with the Open Mower software. You can disconnect it from your Windows PC.
