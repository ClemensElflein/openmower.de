  Running the website on OpenMowerOS
</h2>

Since [OpenMowerOS](https://github.com/ClemensElflein/OpenMowerOS) already ships with the container engine [Podman](https://podman.io/) it is very easy to use deploy a container here.

- ssh as the openmower user into your mower and then clone this repo: 
  ```bash
  cd ~/
  git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ClemensElflein/openmower.de
  cd ~/openmower.de/
  ```

- Build the container:
  ```bash
  podman build -t openmower.de .
  ```

- Now make your changes to the files and then start the container.
  ```bash
  podman run --detach --name openmower.de --publish 1313:1313 --volume ./:/src/ openmower.de
  ```

- Be patient while the container installs all dependencies and builds the website. üçµ  
  You can check its logs by
  ```bash
  podman logs -f openmower.de
  ```

  If you see the following lines the container successfully build the website and you can access it on port `1313` of you mower ([openmower.local:1313](http://openmower.local:1313))

> [!TIP]
> You can now make your changes on the fly - the container watches the source and will rebuild individual sites automatically on changes.

If for some circumstances it does not rebuild you can try to restart the container:
```bash
podman restart openmower.de
```

<br>
<hr>
<br>

Once you are done you can stop the container
```bash
podman stop openmower.de
```

If you do not plan to edit the site once more you can remove the container and the images.
```bash
podman rm openmower.de
podman rmi openmower.de docker.io/klakegg/hugo:0.111.3-ext-ubuntu
```

  Running the website locally on Bare Metal
</h3>

Building and running the site locally requires a recent `extended` version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).  
You can find out more about how to install Hugo for your environment in our
[Getting started](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/#prerequisites-and-installation) guide.

Once you've made your working copy of the site repo, from the repo root folder, run:
```bash
hugo server
```

<br>

<h3 id="running-local-docker-compose">
  Running the website locally on Docker Compose
</h3>

You can run openmower.de inside a container _([Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/))_, the container runs with a volume bound to the `docsy-example` folder. This approach doesn't require you to install any dependencies other than [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on Windows and Mac, and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on Linux.

- Build the docker image
   ```bash
   docker compose build
   ```

- Run the built image
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
> [!TIP]
> You can run both commands at once with `docker compose up --build`.

- Verify that the service is working.

   Open your web browser and type `http://localhost:1313` in your navigation bar,
   This opens a local instance of the openmower.de homepage. You can now make
   changes to the website and those changes will immediately show up in your
   browser after you save (not on Windows though. Hot reload only works on the non-dockerized hugo!).

### Cleanup

To stop Docker Compose, on your terminal window, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.

To remove the produced images run:
```bash
docker compose rm
```
For more information see the [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/).

As you run the website locally, you may run into the following error:
```
‚ûú hugo server

```

This error occurs if you have not installed the extended version of Hugo.
See this [section](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/get-started/docsy-as-module/installation-prerequisites/#install-hugo) of the user guide for instructions on how to install Hugo.

Or you may encounter the following error:
```
‚ûú hugo server

Error: failed to download modules: binary with name "go" not found
```

This error occurs if you have not installed the `go` programming language on your system.
See this [section](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/get-started/docsy-as-module/installation-prerequisites/#install-go-language) of the user guide for instructions on how to install `go`.
